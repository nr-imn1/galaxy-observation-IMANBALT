<h1 style="Font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration:underline">The Solar System</h1>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
While astronomers have discovered thousands of other worlds orbiting distant stars, our best knowledge about 
<br>planets, moons, and life comes from one place. The Solar System provides the only known example of a habitable 
<br>planet, the only star we can observe close-up, and the only worlds we can visit with space probes. Solar 
<br>System research is essential for understanding the origin and evolution of planets, along with the conditions 
<br>necessary for life.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration: underline">Planets and their Moons</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The eight planets can be divided into two distinct categories on the basis of their densities (mass per unit volume). 
<br>The four inner, or terrestrial, planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—have rocky compositions and densities 
<br>greater than 3 grams per cubic cm. (Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic cm.) In contrast, the four outer planets, 
<br>also called the Jovian, or giant, planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are large objects with densities less 
<br>than 2 grams per cubic cm; they are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium (Jupiter and Saturn) or of ice, rock, 
<br>hydrogen, and helium (Uranus and Neptune). The dwarf planet Pluto is unique—an icy, low-density body smaller 
<br>than Earth’s Moon, more similar to comets or to the large icy moons of the outer planets than to any of the planets 
<br>themselves. Its acceptance as a member of the Kuiper belt explains these anomalies.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The relatively small inner planets have solid surfaces, lack ring systems, and have few or no moons. The atmospheres 
<br>of Venus, Earth, and Mars are composed of a significant percentage of oxidized compounds such as carbon dioxide. 
<br>Among the inner planets, only Earth has a strong magnetic field, which shields it from the interplanetary medium. 
<br>The magnetic field traps some of the electrically charged particles of the interplanetary medium inside a region 
<br>around Earth known as the magnetosphere. Heavy concentrations of these high-energy particles occur in the Van 
<br>Allen belts in the inner part of the magnetosphere.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The four giant outer planets are much more massive than the terrestrial planets and have immense atmospheres composed 
<br>mainly of hydrogen and helium. They have no solid surfaces, however, and their densities are so low that one of 
<br>them, Saturn, would actually float in water. Each of the outer planets has a magnetic field, a ring system, and 
<br>many known moons, with more likely to be discovered. Pluto has no known rings and only five known moons. Several 
<br>other Kuiper belt objects and some asteroids also have moons of their own.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Most of the known moons move around their respective planets in the same direction that the planets orbit the Sun. 
<br>They are extremely diverse, representing a wide range of environments. Jupiter is orbited by Io, a body wracked by 
<br>intense volcanism, while Saturn’s largest moon, Titan—a body larger than the terrestrial planet Mercury—exhibits a 
<br>primitive atmosphere denser than that of Earth. Triton moves in a retrograde orbit around Neptune—that is, 
<br>opposite to the direction of the planet’s orbit around the Sun—and features plumes of material rising through its 
<br>tenuous atmosphere from a surface whose temperature is only 37 kelvins (K; −393 °F, −236 °C).</p>
